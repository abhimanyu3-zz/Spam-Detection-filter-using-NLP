# Spam-Detection-filter-using-NLP
Developed a spam detection filter with the help of NLTK library to segregate the difference between a ham and a spam text message. Ham in the project refers to an e-mail or message which is
considered to be a good mail. Spam refers to an e-mail or message which is inappropriate and irrelevant,
while is usually sent out in bulk to large number of recipients. The data has been analysed for the
segregation of hams and spams using labels, determining the frequency using a sparse matrix, training and
testing the dataset, and determining the accuracy of various classification algorithms to determine which
has the maximum accuracy in this case. I have worked with NLTK library and stopwords package to
work on this project.
